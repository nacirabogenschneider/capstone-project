# Schulweg - sicher zur Schule

The webdeveloper bootcamp at [neuefische ](https://www.neuefische.de/) includes a digital capstone project, this is an app or web application that you develop in the last 4 weeks of the bootcamp.

My capstone project is a React App. With it parents can organize themselves to let their primary school children go to school in accompanied groups.

Parents log in to the app. They create a profile and register themselves and their children there. Then you select a state and a school. There you can register in existing meeting points or create your own. From the meeting point you create a running list with name and time when the group starts running. Other parents can now enter themselves and their children or only their children for the running list.

Going to school together in accompanied groups relieves both parents and traffic. It counteracts the parent taxi problem without the parents having to worry about whether the child will get to school safely.
